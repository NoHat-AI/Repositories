The answer to hte first question at the bottom of the task is Ann Gree Shepherd.

Step 4: Investigate the JPG image file using exiftool command. ($ sudo exiftool letter-image.jng)
We  get a large list of data that was attached to the image such as file name, date/time of modified, file type, camara model namem, software on the camera, GPS coordinates, etc.
We can find the answer to the second question at the bottom of Task 3.

Step 5: Use the GPS coordinate from the image data to find location where the image was taken.
Copy and paste the latitude and longitude into a mapping website. We used FindLatitudeAndLongitude.com
LAT: 51 deg 30' 51.90" N 
LNG: 0 deg 5' 38.73" W
The location is on Milk Street in the city of London.

Step 6: Find what camera model the kidnapper used to answer the last question at the bottom of the task.
If we refer to the top of the data extracted by our exiftool command, we can see that the camera used was a Canon EOS R6.
