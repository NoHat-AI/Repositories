One typical attack is to get access to a remotre system. We can accomplish this by getting target machine to run malicious file or by obtaining a username and password.
Generally, after getting some access to a remote system, attackers wiil try to escalate they privillage level to a system administrator. 
'root' account is typically the system administrator on Android, Apple, and Linux OS. 'administrator' on MS Windows systems.

Target IP: 
10.10.191.46

Additional Info: 2 sticky notes on PC screen, sammie and dragon.

Task: Get remote access to traget IP.

Step 1: Start AttackBox and open terminal.

Step 2: Connect to the target IP remote machine via SSH. User name is sammie.
Type in 'yes' and press enter to authenticate the SSH-fingerprint. 
Input password 'dragon' when promoted.
 
$ SSH sammie@10.10.191.46

Step 3: Change directory 'cd' to the home direcotry ($ cd ..) and list information of the direcotry ($ ls).
We see 'sammie', and 3 other names which apear to me usernames. johnny, linda, sammie, strategos.

Step 4: Switch users to johnny ($ su - johnny).
Try guessing the password using 7 most common passwords. 
Figure out password is abc123.

Step 5: Using 'history' command in command line, find that johnny switched to root, and potentially leaked password of 'happyHack!iNG"

Step 6: 'su' to root and enter password when prompted. After executing 'ls' command in the ~ direcotry, we see 'flag.txt".

Flag is THM{YouGotRoot}
