This is a write up for Task 3 of the Web Application Security room on TryHackMe.com

Target: https://inventory-management.thm/

Task: Use Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) to access information that you should not have access to.
Find the flag.
To find flag, revert the changes of an attacker that was able to get unauthorized access via an employee account.

Step 1: Click the 'View Site' button to launch target website inside THM web page.

Step 2: Enumurate the website. Find anything that may be useful in finding changes and reverting them.
upon inpsction, we found an 'Activity' tab. This will bring us to a new web page with a URL ending in id=10. 
This is a vulnerability we can use.

Step 3: By changing the number at the end of the URL we can view several different employee profiles and 
their recent activity. Upon investigating URL ending in id=9, Alya's profile, we see that we are able to 
revert the most recent changes made from her profile. 

Step 4: Press the 'Revert' button next each line item to revert all changes. Once done flag will pop on-screen.


FLAG:
THM{IDOR_EXPLORED}
